# This workflow will trigger Datadog Synthetic tests within your Datadog organisation
# For more information on running Synthetic tests within your GitHub workflows see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/cicd_integrations/github_actions/

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# To get started:

# 1. Add your Datadog API (DD_API_KEY) and Application Key (DD_APP_KEY) as secrets to your GitHub repository. For more information, see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/.
# 2. Start using the action within your workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:

  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4.4.3
  with:
    # Artifact name
    name: # optional, default is artifact
    # A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes what to upload
    path: 
    # The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.
Available Options:
  warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
  error: Fail the action with an error message
  ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

    if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
    # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

    retention-days: # optional
    # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

    compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

    overwrite: # optional, default is false
    # If true, hidden files will be included in the artifact. If false, hidden files will be excluded from the artifact.

    include-hidden-files: # optional, default is false
